**Project Name:** GolfScore


**Is your project New or Old?** New Project


**Is your project Solo or Team?** Solo Project


## Description

GolfScore is an iOS application that aims to make it as easy as possible to keep track
of your golf scores. Other apps offer this but as a side feature among a wide and daunting 
list of other features. GolfScore will appeal mostly to the casual golfer as the go to way 
to keep track of their rounds.

## Challenges I Anticipate

I think a challenge will be making the app look nice such as getting the right color scheme,
design of text inputs and fonts and things such as those.

## Skateboard

Have the user be able to input, hole by hole, the par of the hole and the score they got. And then at the end of 
either 9 holes or 18 holes their score is added up and presented in a nice way

## Bike

Add persistence to the users scores, organize the scores by date.

## Car

Implement a golf course api so users do not have to manually input the par for each hole. The user could just search the course and 
then the only thing left for them to do is input each score after each hole.

## Personal Achievement Goals:

### Teammate 1

1. Have the app be responsive on a range of iOS devices
1. Sharpen my UIKit and layout skills
1. Make this app something that me and my friends will use
